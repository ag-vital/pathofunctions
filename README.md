# pathofunctions
<em>'Borders between so-called opportunistic pathogens, pathobionts and commensals are increasingly blurred and specific (individual taxonomic) targets for manipulating microbiota to improve host health are becoming elusive.' </em> -Rath et al. Microbiome 2018

That's why we introduced the [pathofunction concept](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0542-0) that focuses on harmful functions of whole communities and not on individual bacterial taxa.

Here you can download sequences of genes encoding trimethylamine-forming pathways as described in [Rath et al. 2017, Microbiome](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0271-9).
Sequences of genes encoding the <em>bai</em> operon [Vital et al. 2019, CSBJ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037019302235?via%3Dihub) are available as well.
